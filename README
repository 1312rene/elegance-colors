Elegance Colors is a chameleon theme for Gnome Shell. It can change colors according to the current GTK theme, current wallpaper (uses imagemagick to get color) or a user defined color. Also various other aspects of the theme are customizable.

Installation Instructions:

Ubuntu users can install Elegance Colors from our themes PPA using the following commands,

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:satyajit-happy/themes
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-theme-elegance-colors

If you don't use Ubuntu, you need to compile from source. This is needed for the GUI.

Don't worry, it is easy and straight forward.

You need to install the build-dependencies first (package names may vary depending on your distro),

glib2-devel gtk3-devel vala

Extract the archive, navigate to the directory and type the following commands in a terminal,

make
sudo make install

To derive color from wallpaper, you need to install ImageMagick

Also install the User Theme Extension for Gnome Shell https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/

After installation, run "elegance-colors" from the terminal to start the process in background. The background process detects changes and reloads the theme accordingly. It will also make a theme basing upon the template and default configuration.

To set the theme, run the following commands,

gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name 'elegance-colors'

You can launch the GUI from the menu which lets you customise various aspects of the the theme. You can also export your customized theme, import/export settings from the GMenu. Click on the title in the Gnome Shell top bar to get the GMenu.
