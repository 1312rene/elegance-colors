.SH NAME
elegance-colors \- chameleon theme for gnome shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
Elegance Colors is a chameleon theme for Gnome Shell. It can change colors according to the current GTK theme, current wallpaper (uses imagemagick to get color) or a user defined color. Also various other aspects of the theme are customizable.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
After installation, run
.B elegance-colors
from the terminal to start the process in background. The background process detects changes and reloads the theme accordingly. It will also make a theme basing upon the template and default configuration.

To set the theme, run the following commands,

.B gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name 'elegance-colors'

You can launch the GUI from the menu which lets you customise various aspects of the the theme. You can also export your customized theme, import/export settings from the GMenu. Click on the title in the Gnome Shell top bar to get the GMenu.

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
If you have installed the user-theme extension from the extensions.gnome.org website, you might need to run the following command before elegance-colors can work,

.B elegance-colors fix

To view any error messages produced, stop the background process first and then run the process in Terminal,

.B elegance-colors stop
.B elegance-colors start

To manually apply changes, run,

.B elegance-colors apply

To export the theme, run,

.B elegance-colors export /path/to/themefile.zip

.SH NOTES
The configuration file is automatically created and replaced every time you change the configuration. It should not be edited by hand.

.SH CAVEATS
When applying the new configuration, the theme is reloaded, and Gnome Shell may freeze if you do things really fast when reloading the theme.
